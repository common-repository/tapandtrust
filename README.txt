Tap&Trust detects malicious links in comments and blocks them (with the WOT API - Web Of Trust).


== Description ==


Tap&Trust allows to block links in comments having a poor reputation. A colored circle will be displayed at the right of each link.

You can defined the threshold of the trustworthiness and  the child safety to block links (a value between 0 and 100 corresponding to the minimum of the rating).

Also, a tool allows to analyze every links in your comments / posts /pages. You will be able to disapprove comments having links with a poor reputation.

Finally, if you want to claim your site on WOT (Web Of Trust), the plugin suggests a tool which will allow you to do it easly.

**You will need to have an account at WOT and to have an API key (all is free!)**

= Lock all links before to know their rating with WOT =

If the WOT API does not work (bad API key or API is down, etc.) or if the visitor has disabled javascript and this option is activated, every links in comments will be disabled.
If this option is disabled (default) all links will be clickable if there is an error with the WOT API.

= Lock links having an unknown rating =

Some sites do not have a rating at WOT, so they have an unknown rating (grey doughnut icon).

It is possible to block this kind of links by checking the option.

By default, sites with an unknown ratings are clickable.

= Customize thresholds for disabling links =

There are two kind of ratings:

 - Trustworthiness
 - Child safety

That's why there are two counters where you can define your custom thresholds.

For that, just move  the central hand or enter a value for Trustworthiness and / or Child safety.

If one of the two ratings of a site is lower than these values, the link will be disabled.

Default value are 60/100 for both ratings.
